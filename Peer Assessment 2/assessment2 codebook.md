## Fatalities and Injuries

Direct Fatalities/Injuries. A direct fatality or injury is defined as a fatality or injury directly attributable to the hydro-meteorological event itself, or impact by airborne/falling/ moving debris, i.e., missiles generated by wind, water, ice, lightning, tornado, etc. In these cases, the weather event was an “active” agent or generated debris which became an active agent. 	
Fatalities and injuries directly caused by the weather event will be entered in the Storm Data software “fatality” and “injury” entry fields, respectively.


## Damage

Property damage estimates are actual dollar amounts, or reasonably accurate estimate from an insurance company or other qualified individual is available, or a guesstimate.

Crop Damage Data. Crop damage information may be obtained from reliable sources, such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the county/parish agricultural extension agent, the state department of agriculture, crop insurance agencies, or any other reliable authority. Crop damage amounts may be obtained from the USDA or other similar agencies.

Other Related Costs. The cost of such items as snow removal, debris clearing/moving, fire fighting, personnel overtime charges, public housing assistance, etc., will not be tallied as directly-related parts of the storm/crop damage. If “other related” cost estimates are available, they may be included in the narrative as a separate item (“for information only”), and stated as such.
